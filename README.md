# A* algorithm
Getting to know the A* path search algorithm. Most of the code is from [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtiK0DOeI4A), but I made small additions in it. Requires Python 3.x (at least 3.9 is working), and pygame installed.<br /><br />
Commands:<br />
Left mouse: mark the start and end; draw the walls and obstacles<br />
Right mouse button: erase obstacles and start / end nodes<br />
Spacebar: start / stop visualisation<br />
c: clear the space<br />
r: create a random scene
